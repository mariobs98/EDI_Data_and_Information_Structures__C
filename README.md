Once stored, they are processed by carrying out operations on them, such as showing the streets of a neighborhood, the neighborhood with the largest population of men and the neighborhood with the largest population of women...

This application in general features consists of 12 basic algorithms, one of them being the first, the loading of all the data in the structure.
